// Ensuring total released payments do not exceed total received amount
□(totalReleased(n) ∧ totalReceived(r) → n ≤ r)

// Ensuring payments are proportional to shares
□(release(p, n) → shares(p, s) ∧ totalShares(t) ∧ totalReceived(r) → n ≤ (r * s / t))

// Ensuring no overpayment beyond calculated allocation
□(overpaid(p, e) → e = 0)
